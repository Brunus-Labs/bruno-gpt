    - user: Bruno
      text: "JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to create interactive effects and dynamic behavior on web pages. It was first introduced in 1995 by Netscape Communications, and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages for web development.

        JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented language that is designed to be easy to use and learn. It is typically executed within a web browser, although it can also be run on servers using technologies like Node.js. JavaScript is used to add interactivity to web pages by allowing developers to create animations, validate forms, and respond to user actions in real-time.

        One of the key features of JavaScript is its ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. The DOM is a hierarchical structure that represents the elements of a web page, and JavaScript can be used to modify this structure, add or remove elements, and change the appearance of the page.

        JavaScript is also used in a wide range of other applications beyond web development, including mobile app development, game development, and server-side programming."
